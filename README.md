# Amazon_Lex_Lambda

This is our Assignment for Genese Cloud Academy Interestship programme. In this week we made a chatbot in Amazon Lex and used it to make a user friendly bot which helps us to find the weather for a certain City with the aid of Amazon Lambda Function. 

The Code for the lambda function is present in the file lambda.py.
